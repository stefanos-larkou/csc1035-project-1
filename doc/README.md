# CrimeReporting

This package is built as a part of the CSC1035: Programming Portfolio 2.

After running ReportingIO, you may pick from the following options:

    1) Create a new district to add to Reporting. (None will be created
       if the name given to the new district already exists.) 

    2) Create a new incident. (After entering the new incident's 
       details you will be asked to add it to a district. If the name
       entered matches one of the existing districts, the incident will
       be added to that district. Otherwise, it will be added to a new
       district with the name entered.) 

    3) Get the name of the district with the highest average value of
       goods stolen for a year of your choice. (If there have been no
       incidents in that year, there are no incidents or districts in
       general you will be notified and will return to the menu.
       Also, if it is a tie then the first found will be returned.)

    4) Get the highest value incident ever reported. (If there are no
       incidents or districts you will be notified and will return
       to the menu.)

    5) Get all incidents with value of goods stolen greater than an
       amount of your choice. (If there are no incidents or districts
       you will be notified and will return to the menu.)


    6) Display all district names. (If there are no districts you will
       be notified and return to the menu.)

    7) Display all incidents in their respective districts. (If there 
       are no incidents or districts you will be notified and will 
       return to the menu.)

    8) Display all incidents recorded in a district of your choice.
       (If the district you entered doesn't exist you will be notified
       and return to the menu.) 

    9) Quit the program.


**After each action you will always return to the menu until you enter
9 to quit the program.**
